Java async code usage examples

In core service you could find examples of async java using:
1. Java core
2. ProjectReactor

To run code use tests. 
Tests used only to run code, not to check it (always green). 
Each test waits for 60 sec to give async processes time to finish


How to start:
1. run cloud-config
2. run eureka
3. run tests from core-service
